stk500 is an Erlang implementation of enough of the STK500 protocol to
talk to an Arduino.


## Example

    % Open the serial device attached to the Arduino
    % The Diecimila uses 19200
    {ok,FD} = stk500:open("/dev/ttyUSB0", [{speed, 19200}]),

    % Read a hex file generated by the Arduino IDE
    %
    % hex_file/1 returns a list of binaries as read from the
    % file (16 bytes). It's faster to use 128 bytes chunks.

    Hex = stk500:hex_file("doc/counter.cpp.hex"),
    Bytes = stk500:chunk(Hex, 128),

    stk500:load(FD, Bytes).
